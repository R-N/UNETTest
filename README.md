# UNETTest
I wanted to make this a game, but nevermind. Feel free to use this. Here you can find:
- NAT Punchthrough
- Mobile GPU-Based Visibility, Sight, Field of View, Fog of War
- Movement Sync for free movement using impulse (well, not really, not calculating mass), constant timed movement, and gravity related movement.
